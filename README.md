# NakamotoFallacyMint (NAKV)

## Overview
NakamotoFallacyMint is an ERC20 token implementation with a unique minting and reflection mechanism designed for the Avalanche C-Chain. The contract incorporates a phased minting system with decreasing rewards and a proportional reflection mechanism that distributes tokens to existing holders.

## Technical Specifications

### Token Metrics
- Name: Nakamoto Fallacy Mint
- Symbol: NAKV
- Decimals: 18
- Initial Owner Allocation: 10,000 NAKV

### Core Features

#### Phase-Based Minting System
The minting mechanism operates in phases, with each phase doubling the wallet limit and halving the rewards:
- Phase 1 (0-100k wallets): 1 NAKV per mint
- Phase 2 (100k-200k wallets): 0.5 NAKV per mint
- Phase 3 (200k-400k wallets): 0.25 NAKV per mint
- Phase 4 (400k-800k wallets): 0.125 NAKV per mint
- Subsequent phases follow the same pattern

#### Reflection Mechanism
During each mint operation, a percentage of the minted amount is distributed to existing token holders:
- Phase 1: 50% reflection rate
- Phase 2: 25% reflection rate
- Phase 3: 12.5% reflection rate
- Phase 4: 6.25% reflection rate
- Distribution is proportional to holders' token balance
- Contract owner is excluded from reflection distribution

### Reflection Fee Mechanism During Minting  

During the minting process, the reflection mechanism distributes payments to all existing holders. If the AVAX gas fees for a given mint are not profitable, no inflation or rewards can be generated. However, in cases where there is profitability due to price increases, any user can mint tokens from a wallet that hasnâ€™t previously participated. By doing so, the cost they incur helps maintain the price stability.  

Additionally, a significant portion of the newly minted tokens is reflected back to existing holders as payments. This means that even if a holder lacks the "economic capacity" to participate in the profitable minting process, the miner effectively compensates them through the reflection mechanism.  

This system is fully dependent on price profitability. In summary:  
- **If the token price falls below gas fee costs (reflection distribution costs), no one will mint tokens**, ensuring price protection.  
- **If profitability exceeds gas fee costs**, someone will pay the cost to mint tokens and distribute reflection payments to all holders.  

Warning: Due to the reflection feature, minting might not be possible at a single point within one block as we might exceed the gas limit per block.

#### Dynamic Adjustment After Large Mint Events  

Following a large-scale mint (e.g., 100,000 wallets), rewards will be halved. To address this, the reflection distribution is incrementally reduced from 50% to 25%. This approach creates a balanced system where inverse correlation becomes possible, ensuring stability and fairness within the ecosystem.

#### Minting Eligibility
- One-time minting per wallet address
- Minimum gas expenditure requirement: 1.1 nAVAX
- Gas usage verification within the last 1,000,000 blocks

### Smart Contract Architecture

#### State Variables
```solidity
uint256 public constant INITIAL_OWNER_ALLOCATION = 10_000 * 10**18;
uint256 public constant PHASE_WALLET_COUNT = 100_000;
uint256 public constant BLOCKS_LOOKBACK = 1_000_000;
uint256 public constant MIN_GAS_SPENT = 11 * 10**8; // 1.1 nAVAX

uint256 public totalMintedWallets;
uint256 public totalReflected;
mapping(address => bool) public hasMinted;
mapping(address => uint256) public lastMintBlock;
```

#### Token Holder Management
- Automatic tracking of token holders
- Dynamic holder list updates during transfers
- Automatic removal of zero-balance addresses
- Efficient holder management for reflection distribution

#### Events
```solidity
event TokensMinted(address indexed wallet, uint256 amount, uint256 reflectedAmount);
event ReflectionDistributed(uint256 amount);
```

### Security Features

#### Access Control
- Owner-specific functions protected by `onlyOwner` modifier
- Ownership transfer capabilities
- Ownership renouncement option

#### Safety Mechanisms
- Double-minting prevention
- Zero-address transaction prevention
- Overflow/underflow protection (Solidity ^0.8.20)
- Automated holder list management
- Owner exclusion from reflection system

### Public Functions

#### View Functions
- `getCurrentMintAmount()`: Returns current phase mint amount
- `getCurrentReflectionRate()`: Returns current phase reflection rate
- `isEligibleForMint(address)`: Checks wallet eligibility for minting
- Standard ERC20 view functions

#### State-Modifying Functions
- `mint()`: Primary minting function with reflection distribution
- Standard ERC20 transfer functions
- Ownership management functions

## Implementation Notes

### Gas Optimization
- Efficient token holder management
- Optimized reflection distribution algorithm
- Smart storage usage for holder tracking

### Oracle Integration
The contract includes a placeholder for gas expenditure verification, which should be replaced with a proper oracle implementation in production:
```solidity
// Current placeholder implementation
gasSpent = wallet.balance > 0 ? MIN_GAS_SPENT : 0;
```

## Security Considerations
1. The contract implements standard ERC20 security practices
2. Reflection calculations should be monitored for large holder counts
3. Gas expenditure verification should be implemented via a reliable oracle
4. Phase transitions are automatic and deterministic

## Future Improvements
1. Implementation of a proper oracle for gas expenditure verification
2. Optional emergency pause mechanism
3. Enhanced reflection distribution optimization for large holder bases
4. Additional holder incentive mechanisms
